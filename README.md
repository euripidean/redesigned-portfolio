# Portfolio Page Redesign -

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Original Design Screenshots

This project was originally styled using TailwindCSS. As part of my school assignment, I need to restyle it completely using Vanilla CSS.
